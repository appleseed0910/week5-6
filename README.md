# Week5-6 Checkpoint

DGM6410 Game Design Tech Lab

This repository contains:


-  Inquiry
-  Research notes
-  Research Demo
-  Futher Research expectations

In last two weeks, I kepet reading and learn from the book *Writing Interactive Fiction With Twine*. 
<br>But based on last comment that I received, I'd take care of presenting the research process more clearly.
<br>(I've also learned a bit about using GithubPages and Github formatting marks this week. Efficient tool and knowledge!)
