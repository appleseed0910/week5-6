# Week5-6 Checkpoint

DGM6410 Game Design Tech Lab

This repository contains:


-  Inquiry
-  Research notes
-  Research Demo
-  Futher Research expectations

In last two weeks, I kepet reading and learn from the book *Writing Interactive Fiction With Twine*. 

But based on last comment that I received, I'd take care of presenting the research process more clearly.

(I've also learned a bit about using GithubPages and Github formatting marks this week. Efficient tool and knowledge!)

## Research

### 1. Vitrual map and Puzzel Design 
I bind these two topics together not only because in the book the two chapters are connected, but also after I read them thoroughly, I think these two elements are highly relevant to each other.
