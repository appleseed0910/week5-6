In last two weeks, I kepet reading and learn from the book *Writing Interactive Fiction With Twine*. 

But based on last comment that I received, I'd take care of presenting the research process more clearly.

(I've also learned a bit about using GithubPages and Github formatting marks this week. Efficient tool and knowledge!)

## Research

### 1. Vitrual map and Puzzel Design 
I bind these two topics together not only because in the book the two chapters are connected, but also after I read them thoroughly, I think these two elements are highly relevant to each other. This concept is more on content level rather than detail technique level, I think. But still very important.

In multiple classic or popular CYOA games, setting decription usually relates to puzzles and provides hints for the puzzles.

Such as, in **Zork**, the setting is just the puzzle itself. Everything is presented in the game is useful for a certain goal. The puzzle for the players is to figure out how to correctly interact with these objects.

Whereas, Twine allows us to create choice branches instead. In some games that I've played such as [
Turing Trial](https://rtgrl.itch.io/turing-trial) and [Egress](https://thealeks.itch.io/egress), the map of the game is described with plain text, and player moves between locations through choices. It also reminds me some commercial games like **Lifeline series**. Although some of them don't have a *map* view, the players still have a clear memory or cognition of their locations.

In the book *chapter 3 Creating a Vivid setting*, the author picked the maze as an ultimate chanllenge, which means the setting itself would be a puzzle for the players. This smoothly switched the topic to the next *chapter 4 Designing Puzzles*. There is more deep and practical tips and knowledge need to pay attention here.

Not like some games with graphics, the puzzle that we could make in Twine more likely to be text. (We could insert imgs when we need, but hardly to make some interactions but a just plain picture, which declines fun of graphic puzzle I think.) In
